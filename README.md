# Blockchain Voting System

This project is part of a **graduation capstone** system consisting of three main components that together form a blockchain-based voting platform.

## System Architecture Overview

| Component                                | Description                                                                                            | Repository                                                                   |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Blockchain Node**                      | Core blockchain engine responsible for recording votes and maintaining consensus.                      | [vote-blockchain-server](https://github.com/andantan/vote-blockchain-server) |
| **API Gateway & User Management Server** | Handles REST API requests, authentication, and communication between the frontend and blockchain node. | *(this repository)*                                                          |
| **MongoDB Caching Server**               | Caches blockchain data and transaction metadata for faster queries.                                    | [vote-cache-server](https://github.com/andantan/vote-cache-server)           |

All three services **must be running** for the system to function correctly.
